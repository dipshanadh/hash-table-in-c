# Hash table in C

Hash table is a very important data structure that stores the data in an associative manner in an array where each data value has its own unique index. In hash table, the insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data.

This repo consists of the code that I write while learning to implement open-addressed, double-hashed hash tables in C. Writing a hash table in C gives us understanding of how it works under the hood.

# Usage

```sh
gcc -Isrc ./src/*.c -o main && ./main
```
